# Git vs Github?

A quick aside: You may have seen references to "git" in addition to "Github". These are not the same thing (although they are related). Git is a set of command line tools that implement version control. For example:
```
git commit -am "Made changes X and Y to the project because of Z."
```
could be used to save a new version of a project using a terminal.


By contrast, Github is a more user-friendly platform. Although it *is* based on the git tools, it uses a desktop app and website to implement version control. For example:

TODO: insert image

is a snapshot of the desktop interface. In this workshop, we will focus exclusively on Github.
