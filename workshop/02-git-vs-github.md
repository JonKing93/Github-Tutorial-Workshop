# Git vs Github?

A quick aside: You may have seen references to "git" in addition to "Github". These are not the same thing (although they are related).

### Git
Git is a set of command line tools that implement version control. For example:
```bash
git commit -am "Made changes X and Y to the project because of Z."
```
could be used to save a new version of a project using a terminal.

### Github
By contrast, Github is a company that implements a more user-friendly platform around the git tools. In particular, it uses a desktop app and website to implement version control. For example, this:
