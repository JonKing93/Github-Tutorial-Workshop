# So, how does this all work?

Let's go over a quick overview of Github to illustrate some key concepts and vocabulary.

To begin: In order to use Github, the files for a project should be stored in a folder. This folder is known as a **repository** or **repo** for short. Ultimately, the repository will be backed up to the cloud on Github's servers; this cloud repository is known as the **remote repository**.

TODO: Insert figure of repo icon sitting on cloud. Show example "myProject" filetree.

To work on a project, you will need to download the repository to your computer. The repository on your computer is known as the **local repository**. The action of copying the remote repository to your computer is known as **cloning**.

TODO: Build figure to include repo icon sitting on computer. Arrow pointing from cloud labeled clone.

As you make changes to your project, you will want to periodically save it and document your work. When you do so, the current state of your project is saved and added to the project's version history. Each of these versions is known as a **commit**. Likewise the action of making these saves is also known as a **commit** or **committing**.

TODO: Build figure to include several labeled commits and arrows labeled commit.

At this point, the commits are only stored on your local computer. So, after making a few commits, you will want to upload your changes back to the remote repository. This will ensure that your work is backed up and that the remote repository is up to date. The action of uploading your changes to the remote is known as a **push**.

TODO: Build figure to include arrow labeled push pointing back at the cloud.
