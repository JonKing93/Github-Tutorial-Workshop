# Version history

As you make commits, Github compiles your changes in a version history. To access this version history, select the "History" tab.
<img src="..\assets\images\repo-contents-2.png" alt="The contents of the demo repository now include a file named ingredients.txt." style="max-width:450px;display:block">

Here, you should see all the commits you've made to the project so far.  Upon selecting a commit, you will be shown all the files that were changed and the details of those changes on the right side. For example, here is my version history.


### Version History via the Remote Repository

Alternatively, you can see the version history of the remote repository by clicking the "Commits" button in the upper-right of the commit panel,
<img src="..\assets\images\repo-contents-2.png" alt="The contents of the demo repository now include a file named ingredients.txt." style="max-width:450px;display:block">

which will load the version history. For example:
<img src="..\assets\images\repo-contents-2.png" alt="The contents of the demo repository now include a file named ingredients.txt." style="max-width:450px;display:block">

Note that you can click on the buttons with angle brackets to browse or download the files from each point in the version history.
