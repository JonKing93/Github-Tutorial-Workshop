# Push the new file

If you navigate to the remote repository, you'll see that new file does not appear in its contents.

This is because we haven't *pushed* our commit yet. The changes are saved on our local computer, but they haven't been backed up to the cloud. To push the changes, go back to Github Desktop. The top right tab should now say "Push origin" along with the number of commits waiting to be pushed. Click this tab to push your commits.

The remote repository should now include the newly added files (if not, you may need to refresh the browser page). For example:

# Practice practice practice

Try adding more files to your repository, committing them, and pushing them to the remote. In my demo, I'm adding an "instructions" file.
