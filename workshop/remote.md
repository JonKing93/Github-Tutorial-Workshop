# The remote repository

Let's take a look at the remote repository we just created. Head online and login to your Github account. If you are on the main page, then you should see a list of your repositories on the left side of the screen. For example, here is my account with the demo repository.

<img src="..\assets\images\main-page.png" alt="A list of my remote repositories from the main page." style="max-width:700px;display:block">

Find your repository and click on it.

Alternatively, if you are on the page for your user account, then click on the "Repositories" tab on the top of the screen.

<img src="..\assets\images\user-page.png" alt="A user account page with repositories tab at the top." style="max-width:700px;display:block">

You should see a list of your repositories. For example:

<img src="..\assets\images\user-repos.png" alt="A list of my repositories including the demo." style="max-width:700px;display:block">

Find your repository and click on it.

# The repository page



You'll be taken to a page for the repository. Here, you'll find many features and options for interacting with the project.
