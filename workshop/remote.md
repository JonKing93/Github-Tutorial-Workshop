# The remote repository

Let's take a look at the remote repository we just created. Head online and login to your Github account. On the left side of the screen, you will see a list of your repositories. For example, here is my account with the demo repository.

<img src="..\assets\images\remoterepos.png" alt="A list of my remote repositories including the demo repository." style="max-width:362px;display:block">

Find your repository and click on it. You'll be taken to a page for the repository. Here, you'll find many features and options for interacting with the project.
