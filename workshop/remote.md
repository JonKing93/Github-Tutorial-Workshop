# The remote repository

Let's take a look at the remote repository we just created. Head online and login to your Github account. If you are on the main page, then you should see a list of your repositories on the left side of the screen. For example, here is my account with the demo repository.

<img src="..\assets\images\main-page.png" alt="A list of my remote repositories from the main page." style="max-width:700px;display:block">

Find your repository and click on it.

Alternatively, if you are on the page for your user account, then click on the "Repositories" tab on the top of the screen.

<img src="..\assets\images\user-page.png" alt="A user account page with repositories tab at the top." style="max-width:700px;display:block">

You should see a list of your repositories. For example:

<img src="..\assets\images\user-repos.png" alt="A list of my repositories including the demo." style="max-width:700px;display:block">

Find your repository and click on it.

# The repository page

You should find yourself on a page for your repository. For example, here is the page for my demo repo.

<img src="..\assets\images\demo-repo.png" alt="The page for the demo repo on Github's website." style="max-width:700px;display:block">

This page includes many options for interacting with your project, such as:
1. Documenting bugs and organizing to-do lists,
2. Collaborative coding,
3. Creating software releases,
4. Organizing projects into a package,
and many other features. These features are mostly beyond the scope of this workshop, but I'd encourage you to explore them on your own time.

For now, we'll just focus on one feature. In the center of the page, you should see a list of the files in your repository. For example:

<img src="..\assets\images\repo-code.png" alt="The files in my demo repo." style="max-width:700px;display:block">

We can see that the repository is currently tracking two files: the ".gitattributes" file and the README. Let's start adding other files and building up our projects.
