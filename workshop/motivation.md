# I'm a scientist, why should I use Github?

Fundamentally, Github helps implement version control. That is to say: it helps to save, organize, and share different versions of a research project.

### Version History
In scientific fields, it is important to document and justify the steps you take in an analysis. Creating a version history facilitates this process by documenting the changes you make to a project and the reason for making them. Whether you are writing the methods section for a paper or returning to an old project years later, a version history ensures that you know exactly what is happening in your analysis.

Furthermore, a version history makes it easy to restore previous versions of a project. For example, ...

### Back up files
Given the time and effort that goes into research, it's terrible to lose your work. By saving and backing up versions of a project, you can ensure that your work is never lost, even if a computer is destroyed or files are accidentally deleted.

### Organize simultaneous versions of a file
Sometimes it can be useful to use multiple versions of a file simultaneously. For example, you may have a common analysis script that uses different settings for different papers. Managing the different versions of this file is important, as you would not want to apply the wrong settings to an analysis. Github provides a framework for such organization.

### Share versions with collaborators
