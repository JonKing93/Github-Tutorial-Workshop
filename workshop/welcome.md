# Welcome to the workshop!

This workshop is designed to introduce scientists and researchers to the Github platform. We will learn how to use Github to save a version history of files, back up work to the cloud, work with collaborators on a project, and use multiple versions of the same file. In this workshop, we'll discuss:

1. Fundamental git/Github concepts,
2. Creating repositories for projects,
3. Backing up projects with documentation and version control, and
4. Organizing simultaneous versions of files (i.e. branches).

We will also touch on forking code and pull requests, but this will not be a primary focus. Throughout the workshop, I will use a demo project to illustrate key concepts. However, you are strongly encouraged to bring your own projects for the exercises.

### Prerequisites

1. Please [sign up for a Github account](https://github.com) if you do not already have one.
2. Please also [install the Github Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/) on your computer.
3. You will need access to a basic text editor (e.g. Notepad, Textedit, Atom, Vi, etc...)
4. (Optional) Install any preferred coding environments (e.g MATLAB, Pycharm, RStudio, etc).

Alright, let's start the workshop!
