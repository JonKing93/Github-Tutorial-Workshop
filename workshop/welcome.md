# Welcome to the workshop!

This workshop is designed to introduce scientists and researchers to the Github platform. We will learn how to use Github to save a version history of files, back up work to the cloud, share work with collaborators, and use multiple versions of the same file. In this workshop, we'll discuss:

1. Fundamental git/Github concepts,
2. Creating repositories for projects,
3. Backing up projects with documentation and version control, and
4. Organizing simultaneous versions of files (i.e. branches).

Forking code and pull requests will not be a primary focus.

### Prerequisites

1. Please [sign up for a Github account](https://github.com) if you do not already have one.
2. Please also [install Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) on your computer.
3. You will need access to a plain text editor. For example: Notepad, Textedit, Atom, Vi, etc. (Please do not use MS Word).

### Workshop demos

In this workshop, I will use several demos to illustrate how to use Github. If you would like to follow along with the demos, you can download the files used <a href="../demo-files/demo-files.zip" download>here</a>. However, you are also welcome to use your own projects for the exercises.


Alright, let's start the workshop!
