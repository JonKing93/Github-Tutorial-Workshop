# The new repository

So you made a repository, nice! Go ahead and navigate to its folder on your computer (remember, this is wherever we set the local path). Inside you should see three items

1. A folder named ".git",
2. A file named .gitattributes
3. A file named README.md

The first two include various settings and files required to make git and Github work properly. In general, you won't need to interact with them. The file "README.md" is the file created when we selected the README checkbox. The ".md" signifies a "markdown" file, which is a human-readable text file that also supports some formatting options. Go ahead and open it in a text editor.
