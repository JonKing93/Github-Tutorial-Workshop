# Add a file to the repository

Let's add some files to the repository and start building up the project. Start by moving a file into the local repository you created. This can be anything at all, but a code file is a good place to start. Note that trying to manage files larger than 100MB will cause errors, so stick with something small. In my demo, I'm going to add an ingredients list to the repository:

<img src="..\assets\images\repo-contents-2.png" alt="The contents of the demo repository now include a file named ingredients.txt." style="max-width:450px;display:block">

Open up Github Desktop. Under the changes tab, you should see the name of the new file. The file name should be followed by a green plus, indicating that this is a new addition to the repository. On the right side, you can see the contents of the new file. For example:

<img src="..\assets\images\add-file.png" alt="Github desktop shows the name of the new file on the left side, and the contents of the file on the right side." style="max-width:450px;display:block">

# Commit the new file

We're going to make a commit so that this new file is added to the repository. This way, Github will be able to track any changes we make to the file. At the bottom left of Github desktop, you should see the commit interface. It consists of three pieces:

### Commit message
At the top of the commit interface is a field that lets you supply a commit message.
<img src="..\assets\images\add-file.png" alt="Github desktop shows the name of the new file on the left side, and the contents of the file on the right side." style="max-width:450px;display:block">
This is required for every commit and lets you record the changes you've made to the project.

### Commit description
In the middle is a field that lets you provide a commit description.
<img src="..\assets\images\add-file.png" alt="Github desktop shows the name of the new file on the left side, and the contents of the file on the right side." style="max-width:450px;display:block">
This is optional, and lets you provide greater detail about the changes made in the commit. You can also acknowledge collaborators using the button in the bottom left.

### Commit Button
Once you finish the commit message (and optionally a description), click the button to make the commit.

Congratulations you just made your first commit!
