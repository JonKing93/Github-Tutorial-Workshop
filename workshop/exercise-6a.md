# Track changes to a file

Now that you've added some files to the repository, you can use Github to track any changes you make. Go ahead and makes some edits to one of the files in your repository. Go to Github Desktop. On the left side, under the "Changes", you should see the name of the edited file. The file name should be followed by a yellow dot, which indicates that the file has been edited.

The right hand side will show the contents of the edited file. Lines with a green background show new additions to the file. Lines with a red background show deletions, and lines with a white background have not been altered. For example, in the demo I have adjusted the ingredients list:
<img src="..\assets\images\repo-contents-2.png" alt="The contents of the demo repository now include a file named ingredients.txt." style="max-width:450px;display:block">

You can see that I've:
1. Added onion to the recipe, and
2. Updated the amount of salt.

# Commit Edits

Go ahead and commit your edits and push them to the remote. Navigate back to the page for the remote repository. You can look at the most recent commit messages for each file to see that each has been updated with the edits. For example:
<img src="..\assets\images\repo-contents-2.png" alt="The contents of the demo repository now include a file named ingredients.txt." style="max-width:450px;display:block">

# More Practice
Edit some more files in your project. Make at least two more commits. In my demo, I've removed black pepper from the ingredients list and specified that the vegetables should be boiled for 10 minutes instead of 5.
