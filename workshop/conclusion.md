# That's all folks...

Alright, you've finished the tutorial. Nice work! If you were following along with the demos, try using Github with a real project. If you set up Github for a real project, consider investigating some of the additional features on Github's website. The "Issues" tab might be a useful place to start. You can review any of the concepts or exercises by following the tabs at the top of this website. There's also a glossary under the concepts tab. If you'd like to access the demo repository, it will be available as the [demo branch INSERT LINK] and the [Roasted branch INSERT LINK] of [this workshop's Github repository](https://github.com/JonKing93/Github-Tutorial-Workshop).

# Survey

We'll use the remaining time to implement Github for people's real projects and for troubleshooting. However, before we start the open session, please fill out the survey at INSERT LINK. And thank you all for attending!
