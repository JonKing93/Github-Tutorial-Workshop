# Open Workshop

Alright, you've finished the tutorial. Nice work! You can use the remaining time to try implementing / troubleshooting Github. If you were following along with the demos, try using Github with a real project. If you set up Github for a real project, consider investigating some of the additional features on Github's website. The "Issues" tab might be a useful place to start. You can review any of the concepts or exercises by following the tabs at the top of this website. There's also a glossary under the concepts tab.

We'd appreciate any feedback you can provide, so please fill out the workshop survey before leaving. And thank you all for attending!
